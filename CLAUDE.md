# Claude repository instructions

## Engineering audit operational-efficiency requirement

Whenever Claude performs the repository's Engineering Audit / full-bot bug audit, it must also review the `operational_efficiency_audit` object in the deterministic baseline and, when available, the sanitised VPS snapshot at `ai-reviews:engineering/ops/latest.json`.

Every completed engineering audit must explicitly assess:

1. **API/model cost** — unnecessary paid OpenAI/Gemini/Claude/Copilot calls, duplicate reviews/adjudication, excessive provider fan-out, oversized prompts/context, unnecessary CLI installs, missing cache/material-change gates, and opportunities to use deterministic checks before paid AI.
2. **Server bandwidth** — self-hosted workflow frequency, repository checkouts/fetches, repeated npm/pip downloads, RPC/API polling, logs/artifacts, redundant jobs and other avoidable transfers. Prefer event-driven, shallow, cached and change-only transfers.
3. **Disk usage** — root-filesystem utilisation/free space, runner workspaces, caches, logs, databases, temporary worktrees/artifacts and unbounded retention/growth.

Recommendations are advisory/report-only. Never reduce API or bandwidth cost by weakening wallet/signing, LIVE/ARMED, quote/simulation, liquidity/sellability, capital/reserve, stop-loss/circuit-breaker, nonce or execution-reconciliation protections. Never automatically delete wallet material, databases or audit evidence.
