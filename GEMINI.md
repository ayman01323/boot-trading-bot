# Gemini repository instructions

For every Engineering Audit / full-repository bug audit, read the deterministic baseline's `operational_efficiency_audit` section and include API/model cost, server bandwidth and disk-usage efficiency in the review.

Check for unnecessary paid model calls, duplicated AI cycles, excessive provider fan-out, oversized context, missing material-change/cache gates, repeated CLI/package installs, frequent self-hosted jobs, full-history checkouts, redundant Git/RPC/API polling, oversized logs/artifacts, runner-workspace growth, caches, databases and retention.

Use the sanitised VPS resource snapshot from `ai-reviews:engineering/ops/latest.json` when available. Its network counters measure host non-loopback traffic and must not be falsely attributed to the trading bot alone.

Recommendations are report-only and must never weaken wallet/signing, LIVE/ARMED, simulation, liquidity/sellability, capital/reserve, stop-loss/circuit-breaker, nonce or execution-reconciliation gates. Never automatically delete wallet material, databases or audit evidence.
